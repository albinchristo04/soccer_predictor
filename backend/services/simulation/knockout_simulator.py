"""
Knockout Tournament Simulation Service.

Implements dynamic Monte Carlo simulation for knockout tournaments:
- UEFA Champions League
- UEFA Europa League
- FIFA World Cup

Uses research-based approaches for modeling tournament outcomes,
including bracket position considerations and path dependencies.

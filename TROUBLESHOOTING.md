# Updates I want to be made:
- Analytics page:
    - I am receiving 404 errors for home vs away performance chart as the image is not available. Fix this or remove it entirely.
    - Remove the chart for feature importance, as it is not very useful
    - Ensure the x-axis title for Goals per Match Distribution chart is visible and doesn't get cutoff
    - Goals per Match Distribution chart is still empty, please fix

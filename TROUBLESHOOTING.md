# Updates I want to be made:
- Analytics page:
    - Goals per Match Distribution chart: Align center the axis titles on their respective axes.
    Add descriptive axis titles to be more clear and informative. 
    - Average Goals per Match (by Season) is still an empty chart with no data. Please populate it with relevant data and ensure it displays correctly and add descriptive axis titles to be clear and informative
    - Add any other helpful, descriptive, and informative charts to the analytics page that would provide valuable insights into soccer match data based on the existing data that is being used in the app

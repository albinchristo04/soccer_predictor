# Issues to be fixed:
- When user clicks on the home landing page, either head-to-heaad or cross-league, they should be directed to the respective page. Currently, when clicking on either button, it redirects to only the head-to-head page.
- In the predict tab, the league names in the dropdown are not the correct 9 leagues to be displayed. The correct leagues to be displayed are:
    - Premier League
    - La Liga
    - Serie A
    - Bundesliga
    - Ligue 1
    - Champions League (UCL)
    - Europa League (UEL)
    - MLS
    - FIFA World Cup

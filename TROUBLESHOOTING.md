# To do list of improvements and new features for Soccer Predictor:

Home page:

- Needs to be updated to reflect the new features of the tool (the upcoming matches feature) and should have feature so that when user hovers over a upcoming match, or head-to-head, or cross-league, the card glows and pops up from the background so it is more interactive and engaging.

Models:

- There is a bias towards predicting draws in the matches. This needs to be updated accordingly and fixed because this is not representative of real-world outcomes and with what I am seeing in the ML metrics data for both train and test sets.

## ✨ Features

### Web Application (Frontend)
- **Interactive Predictions:** Easily predict match outcomes for head-to-head and cross-league matchups.
- **League Analytics:** A dedicated analytics page with interactive charts to visualize league statistics, including:
    - Result Distribution (Win/Draw/Loss)
    - Goals per Match Distribution
    - Average Goals per Match by Season
- **Responsive Design:** A clean and modern user interface that works on all screen sizes.
- **Team Selection:** A user-friendly dropdown to select leagues and teams.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- **Head-to-Head Prediction:** Predict the outcome of a single match between two teams in the same league.
- **Cross-League Prediction:** Predict the outcome of a match between two teams from different leagues.
- **Season Simulation:** Run Monte Carlo simulations to project the final league standings for a full season.
- **Data Pipeline:** A series of scripts to automate the entire data pipeline, from scraping to model training.

### Machine Learning Backend
- **Data Scraping:** A robust web scraper to collect historical match data from FBRef.
- **Feature Engineering:** Advanced feature engineering to create meaningful features for the machine learning model.
- **RandomForest Classifier:** A RandomForest model trained on historical data to predict match outcomes.
- **API Server:** A FastAPI backend to serve the machine learning model and analytics data to the frontend.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The application is composed of three main components:

1.  **Frontend:** A Next.js web application that provides the user interface for interacting with the prediction models and viewing analytics.
2.  **Backend:** A FastAPI server that exposes a RESTful API to the frontend. The backend is responsible for handling requests, calling the machine learning service, and providing analytics data.
3.  **Machine Learning Service:** A set of Python scripts that handle the entire machine learning pipeline, including data scraping, data processing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

To run the Soccer Match Predictor locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 18.0 or higher
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/roni-altshuler/soccer_predictor.git
cd soccer_predictor
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install Node.js Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Run the Data Pipeline
To get the latest data and train the models, run the following scripts in order:
```bash
python3 scripts/populate_seasons.py
python3 scripts/fbref_scraper.py
python3 scripts/process_scraped_data.py
python3 scripts/train_league_models.py
```
Alternatively, you can run the automated pipeline script:
```bash
./run_pipeline.sh
```

### 6. Run the Application
To start the frontend and backend servers concurrently, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

***

##  Usage
### Web Interface
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You can use the "Predict" page to make head-to-head and cross-league predictions, and the "Analytics" page to explore league statistics.

### Command-Line Interface
You can also use the CLI to make predictions and run simulations. Here are some examples:

**Head-to-Head Prediction:**
```bash
python3 scripts/predict_and_analyze.py --mode head_to_head --league premier_league --home_team "Manchester City" --away_team "Liverpool"
```

**Cross-League Prediction:**
```bash
python3 scripts/predict_and_analyze.py --mode cross_league --league_a premier_league --team_a "Real Madrid" --league_b la_liga --team_b "Barcelona"
```

**Season Simulation:**
```bash
python3 scripts/predict_and_analyze.py --mode season_simulation --league premier_league --simulations 10000
```
